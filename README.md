# Transcribe
A translating website that translates over a million languages 
# Description
A translating website that takes a user's input and informs them what language it is, then  translates it into whichever language they need it to be for them to understand the information, and can provide an example on how to use said words in a sentence. The key feature is to make online media more accessible to all users by being able to translate media into whatever language makes the user understand the most fluent. The goal of the project is to be able to create a website that can be expanded into more areas of the digital space so that no region is left underserved or underrepresented.
