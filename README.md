# Transcribe
A translating website that translates, detects, and identifies countries for over a million languages.

# Description
Our translation website is divided into three key features that allow every user the ability to understand translated text and manipulate said text into other languages. The first feature know as Language Translate, will take a user's input and translate the given language to a another language of their choosing. The second feature call,ed Language Detect takes the user's input and finds that language that their are using without the user manually adding it in while also showing the ratio of certainty in our results. The third and final feature, Language Locator, will take the user's input language and display all the countries that is spoken by the majority of its citizens. The goal of the project is to be able to create a website that can be expanded cross country communication in the digital space so that no region is left underserved or underrepresented.
